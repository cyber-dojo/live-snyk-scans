At present the snyk-container-test calls are running ok
for some Artifacts, but failing for others.

OK:
- custom-start-points
- exercise-start-points
- languages-start-points
- creator 
- dashboard
- differ
- nginx
- saver
 
FAILING:
- runner
- web 

Current thoughts
- I am assuming it is working for, eg, custom-start-points ; the sarif file doesn't show any vulns.
  Is it possible it is "empty"?
