At present the snyk-container-test calls are running ok
for some Artifacts, but failing for others.

OK:
- custom-start-points
- exercise-start-points
- languages-start-points
- creator 
 
FAILING:
- dashboard
- differ
- nginx
- runner
- saver
- web 

So it appears that recently built Artifacts from github workflows are failing.
Does this correspond to the message I saw in the -debug log, which seemed to 
indicate there were no layers in the image!
