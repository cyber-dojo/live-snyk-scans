See if the matrix can include what it needs to be able to incorporate the
snyk-scan runs for aws-beta and for aws-prod into the same parallelization.

There are two envs to do a get-snapshot for. Each [kosli get snapshot] returns
a json dict. I could merge this into a single array of Artifacts, and then
pass this json array to the python script. To keep the same behaviour as I
currently have, it would be simpler to make a reusable/composite workflow
and call it twice. That can be a later refactoring. For now, create new workflow
and hard-wire the KOSLI_ENV.

Need to pass KOSLI_ENV as argument to artifacts.py ?
